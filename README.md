This program will take in an XLS file from an ICAP 6200 Spectrometer using the horizontal table view.
It will then apply dilution factors and conversion equations as defined by the user in the config file, and spit out a pre-cleaned CSV file.
The pre-cleaned CSV file can now be easily read by a human, there is also an option to do a check correction by using this pre-cleaned file as input and the program will output a finalized CSV.
